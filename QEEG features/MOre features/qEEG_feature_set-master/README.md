NEURAL: A Neonatal EEG Feature Set in Matlab 
============================================

Matlab code to generate a set of quantitative features from multichannel EEG
recordings. Features include amplitude measures, spectral measures, and basic connectivity
measures (across hemisphere's only). Also, for preterm EEG (assuming gestational age < 32
weeks), will generate features from bursts annotations (e.g. maximum inter-burst
interval). Burst annotations require a separate package, also available on
[github](https://github.com/otoolej/burst_detector). 

Full details of the methods can be found in: `JM O’Toole and GB Boylan (2017). NEURAL:
quantitative features for newborn EEG using Matlab. ArXiv e-prints, arXiv:1704.05694`
available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05694.

# requirements:
Matlab (R2013 or newer,
[Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/)) with the signal
processing toolbox and statistics toolbox. Not tested with Octave but should work with minor
tweaking.

# use 

Set paths in Matlab, or do so using the `load_curdir` function:
```matlab
  >> load_curdir;
```

As an example, generate simulated EEG and calculate relative spectral power, standard
deviation of range-EEG, and brain symmetry index:
```matlab
	% generate EEG-like data (coloured Gaussian noise)
	data_st=gen_test_EEGdata(5*60,64,1);

	% define feature set (or can define in neural_parameters.m):
	feature_set={'spectral_relative_power','rEEG_SD', 'connectivity_BSI'};
	
	% estimate features:
	feat_st=generate_all_features(data_st,[],feature_set);
```

See the `demos/` directory for further examples. All parameters are set the file
`neural_parameters.m`.


# quantitative features

The feature set contains amplitude, spectral, connectivity, and burst annotation features.
Amplitude features include range-EEG (D. O’ Reilly et al., 2012;
see [references](#references)), a clearly-defined alternative to amplitude-integrated EEG
(aEEG). All features are generated for four different frequency bands (typically 0.5–4,
4–7, 7–13, and 13–30 Hz), with some exceptions. The following table describes the features
in more detail:
